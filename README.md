# Assembler
This program is designed to simulate an assembler program.
The idea is that the program receives a file containing instructions in assembly language and converts them to machine language.

Instructions for using the assembler: 
1. Open cmd from the project folder.
2. Insert the command: "make" and press enter, now executable files will be created, including "assembler.out"
3. Insert the command: "./assembler.out" + filename* and press Enter.

*filename is the name of the file that contains the assembly code, for the sake of the example you can run the attached file "tester.txt" as filename.

A file called "tester.as" will be created containing the binary encoding in a unique base 2, where the character '.' represents the digit 0, and the character '/' represents the digit 1.
